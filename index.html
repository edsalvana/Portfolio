						<h1>Sculptor Pepper</h1>
						<p>A microsite for Dr Pepper where you can create a 3d model by stacking boxes of Dr Pepper, which you can then view it in Augmented Reality. I did the design, animation and development for the interface. I was amazed at the number of people who actually took the time to make these things, even the inappropriate ones. Created at C&T.
